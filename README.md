# LOK-SABHA  

Hi Everyone, I'm happy to share with you my latest project (LOK SABHA).It's also my submmition to [Codebasics.io 11th challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).. The purpose of this project is to provide meaningful insights about the LOK SABHA's latest 2 rounds.

# Problem Statement

**AtliQ Media is a private media company and they wanted to telecast a show on Lok Sabha elections 2024 in India. Unlike other channels, they do not want to have a debate on who is going to win this election; they rather wanted to present insights from 2014 and 2019 elections without any bias and discuss less explored themes like voter turnout percentage in India. Peter is a data analyst in the company, and he is handed over this task of generating meaningful insights from data. Since this is a sensitive topic, he sought help from his manager Tony Sharma who provided the list of primary and secondary questions.**
